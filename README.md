# Quest Runtime Unity Editor (QRUE)

## Overview

A _bLAzINg FaSt_ (hopefully) desktop app built using Tauri and SolidJS. Like the PC Runtime Unity Editor, this is intended to allow for debugging and modifying Unity objects at runtime, but for games built with il2cpp. It also supports arbitrary C# objects, not only those from Unity.

This is not Electron. ðŸ¦€
Most of the app is built using TypeScript and Node. Tauri is mostly used as a package format, but the rust backend is used for some plugins.

Currently on the roadmap:

- [x] Connect to Quest
- [ ] Reconnection and state
- [x] Wired-only connection
- [x] Unity components list
- [x] Adding components
- [x] Modifying fields
- [ ] Modifying properties
- [x] Invoking methods
- [ ] Byref support
- [ ] Type completion
- [ ] Enumerations
- [ ] Object finding
- [ ] Structure editor
- [ ] Creating objects
- [x] Destroying objects
- [ ] Finalize protobuf schema

### Unlikely ideas

- [ ] Streamed unity camera in the app
- [ ] Browser-only port
- [ ] One-click install of mod
- [ ] Some sort of scripting support

## Build instructions

### Quest mod

Install QPM and the normal quest mod build tools. [Install vcpkg](#installing-vcpkg), run `qpm restore`, and run `qpm s qmod`. To copy changes to your quest without a qmod, run `qpm s copy`.

#### Installing vcpkg

Install [vcpkg](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/vcpkg/get_started/get-started?pivots=shell-cmd#1---set-up-vcpkg) and set the `VCPKG_ROOT` environment variable.

Run `vcpkg install` in this directory. This will download protobuf and websocketpp for the qmod. It may take a while.

Run `pwsh ./make-proto.ps1` to generate the protobuf headers.

### Client app

Install [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/installation) and [rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/tools/install).

If modifying the protobuf schemas, [install vcpkg](#installing-vcpkg) and run `make-proto-ts.ps1` instead of `make-proto.ps1`.

Run `pnpm install` and `pnpm tauri dev`. This will start up both the web frontend and the rust backend, and launch the app when both are ready.

#### Node frontend

To start up the frontend by itself, run `pnpm run dev` and open the URL in the browser (usually <http://localhost:1420>)

Some features may not work without the backend.

#### Debug builds

As stated in the [Tauri docs](https://tauri.studio/docs/debugging/#create-a-debug-build), run `pnpm tauri build --debug` or `cargo tauri build --debug`

#### Release builds

`pnpm tauri build` or `cargo tauri build`
